# free-taxonomy
A human service taxonomy based on Open Eligibility and the Open Referral Human Services Data Standard

The CSV has fields based on the taxonomy table in the Human Services Data Standard, with additional fields corresponding to the ORServices project.

This taxonomy incorporates terms from the Open Eligibility GitHub repo as well as those that are listed on the website but not in the XML.

The original taxonomy had duplicate values of records that can be included in multiple parents. In this taxonomy, each record has only one value and is generally associated with whichever parent had a lower id.
